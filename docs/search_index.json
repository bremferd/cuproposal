I have a lot of transcripts coming from various universities, and I am trying to make a better way to track my meetings, todos, and academic information. My hope is that this will become a proposal and a calendar that will finally get me through my undergraduate degree! 1.1 Incoming Transfer Credits I was a Gilman Scholar at the Universidad Austral de Chile. The course credits were not included in my transfer due to a miscommunication. These should count for my international experience, and be part of my transfer profile. Writing courses were not initially utilized to fulfil my writing requirements. There are many to choose from! Let’s reevaluate! Other courses were not considered, which I believe have suitable equivalents both in CALS and out. In this section I have gathered my credits to explain. 1.2 Completing My Incompletes First Leave Incompletes (2015): My first leave should have been medical. Upon return, I had professor approval to finish, but these credits were not allowed to be completed due to an advising error. Second Leave Incompletes (2020): These should be considered due to the conditions of the times, as well as financial and disability considerations. Here I outline a project plan for completing these courses. 1.3 Final Revised Calendar All this considered, I believe that I can complete my degree with Cornell in one semester. I outline my plan in this section. 1.4 Diagnosis and Letters of Support I was recognized as as a student with a disability while at Cornell, and I finally have a diagnosis and medication. My providers were kind enough to offer their support here.

I was advised by student services that I would not be able to do said work, and that I should not petition as it would be a waste of time. I retook some courses, and allowed others to remain F’s on my transcript. Being that I now understand that my first leave should have been a medical leave, and knowing now that others have been given the exception, I would like to either finish the courses, or have them taken off of my transcripts and have my federal aid refunded. 3.2 Second Leave Incompletes 2020 This leave was in great part due to the conditions around the pandemic, but it was also due to medical conditions, and a denial of loans due to my unrecognized independent student status. I lost my home for the second time at Cornell, and am now petitioning to finish those courses.

A revision of my transfer credit profile. 2. A completion plan for my incomplete credits. With these in mind, I believe that my degree can be completed within a semester of study. 4.1 Proposed Transfer Credit Usage 4.2 Finish Incomplete Courses 4.3 Final Requirements "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
