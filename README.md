# Brief Explanation

There are lots of emails, assignments, files, and approvals that need to happen and I am trying to put them all in one place.

I think that this will give people involved in the project a way to send information, request changes, and see updates on my progress.

Thank you to everyone for your patience, and I hope that we can get through it soon!
